1)  Consider the following class:

--------------------------------------------------------
public class Technology{
   
  String name;
  
  public Technology(String name){
    this.name=name;}
    
  public void speak(){
    System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name);}
    
---------------------------------------------------------    
public class Smartphone extends Technology{
   int number;
   
   public Smartphone(String name, int number){
   super(name);
   this.number = number;
   }
   //part C below
   public void speak(){
   System.out.println("Ring, ring! I am a " + name + ", with phone number " + number);}
---------------------------------------------------------


a)  Write a subclass to Technology with a class called Smartphone.
    Add an additional integer field called number.
    Include a constructor for Technology that takes the "name" and "number" as parameters.
b)  Explain what POLYMORPHISM is.
Polymorphism is when two methods with an identical name that are in a relationship, such as baseclass-subclass, have different functions.
c)  Write a "speak" method for Smartphone that states the "name" and "number".
Done. Point in code commented.
d)  What is this called when we write a subclass method which overrides a super class method?
Method overriding...?
